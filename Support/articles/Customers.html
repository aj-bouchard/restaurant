  <p> <b>Number of Customers Popup:</b><br />
  Follow these steps to enable a window to select the number of customers for a table each time an order is made:
<br /><br />
  1. While in Manager, click <b>Settings</b> and then scroll down to <b>App Settings</b><br />
  2. Click the checkbox next to "<b>Number of customers popup</b>" <br />
  3. Press <b>"Save"</b> at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />

  <b>Assign an order to a Customer without a table</b><br />
  By enabling this option, servers will now have the ability to assign an order to a customer's name instead of having to select a specific table. This is useful for creating temporary customer tabs and managing variable seating arrangements:
<br /><br />
  1. From the iPad Home Screen, open the <b>Settings</b> app. <br />
  2. Scroll down and select <b>Restaurant</b> from the list of apps on the left side of that window.<br /> 
  3. From the resulting menu on the right, scroll down to the very bottom and choose "<b>Developer</b>"<br />
  4. Scroll down to the <b>Functionality Settings</b> and toggle the setting named "<b>Enable the overview panel on the floor view</b>".<br /><br />

  A white arrow pointing to the right should now appear on the left edge of the screen in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/lightspeed-restaurant-pos/id474723658?mt=8"><b>Lightspeed Restaurant POS app</b></a>
